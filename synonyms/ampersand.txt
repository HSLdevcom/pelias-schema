# It seems that ampersand is not used much outside of Western European languages
# with the exception of business names such as 'Johnson & Johnson'.
# In most European languages other than the Germanic ones and French,
# the 'and' word is one letter long (y, i, e, a),
# so no need for an abbreviation made itself felt in the first place.
