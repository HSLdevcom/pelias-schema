# a list of 'safe' street suffix expansions.
#
# this list should NOT include any values where the abbreviation is a prefix of
# the expanded form.
#
# EG. 'st' is a prefix of 'street' so it is not included here.
# EG. 'rd' is NOT a prefix of 'road' so it IS included here.
#
# the term 'safe' refers to whether the token may be expanded without causing
# other issues; in general ask yourself "if i expand `byu => bayou` will this cause
# issues with other tokens which *begin with byu?"
#
# EG. 'pr' is disabled as it would cause jitter when autocompleting any place
# name beginning with 'pr' such as 'princeton', on the second keypress the
# results would likely all contain names which are/begin with "pier".
#
# EG. 'ct' is disabled as expanding it to 'court' would possibly conflict with
# the state abbreviation for 'Connecticut'.
#
# please use judgement when adding new expansions as it may cause the 'jitter'
# behaviour as outlined in https://github.com/pelias/schema/pull/83
