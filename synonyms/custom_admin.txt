# =============================================================================
# This file allows users to add their own custom synonyms below.
#
#  1. Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are comments.
#
#  2. Explicit mappings match any token sequence on the left-hand-side of "=>" and replace with all
#  alternatives on the right-hand-side.
#  These types of mappings ignore the expand parameter in the constructor.
#  Example:
#   i-pod, i pod => ipod
#
#  3. Equivalent synonyms may be separated with commas and give no explicit mapping.
#  In this case the mapping behavior will be taken from the expand parameter in the constructor.
#  This allows the same synonym file to be used in different synonym handling strategies.
#  Example:
#   ipod, i-pod, i pod
#
#  4. Multiple synonym mapping entries are merged.
#  Example:
#   foo => foo bar
#   foo => baz
#  is equivalent to:
#   foo => foo bar, baz
